## How to add a new language?
Just copy the `English` folder and rename it to the language you wish to add. I.E `Spanish`,
then inside there, just edit the files and such. Before you do, you must accept that you'll be able to continually update the language files, as they're not final, we'll continue adding new entries every day!
I created the files using `PhpStorm`, I've left out every required components to just load it up, even though I could of just ignored it using `git-ignore`
